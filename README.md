# Zelda---A-Link-to-the-Past-recreation-
An old school project of "Zelda - A Link to the Past". It's a Java application that looks like the game but has different levels and enemies.

For compilation purposes the application requires javazoom to be installed. You can download it here: https://jar-download.com/artifacts/javazoom/jlayer/1.0.1/source-code
For example copy the jlayer-1.0.1.jar file to the "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-14.0.2\bin" and make sure the path is added to your system environment PATH.

I have uploaded a runnable jar (Zelda.jar) file as well for those interested.
